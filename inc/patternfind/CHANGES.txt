Changes made:

- Ported to C, removed dependency on C++ type vector<T>
- Uses stdint.h type uint8_t instead of unsigned char (for readability)
- Renamed patternfind overloads to patternfind, patternfind_bytes, patternfind_pbyte
- Added VirtualProtect calls to patternwrite function to prevent access violation exceptions
